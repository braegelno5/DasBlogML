DasBlogML
=========

DasBlogML tool allows you to export dasBlog content to BlogML format. 
This is typically useful when migrating from dasBlog to other blogging platforms such as WordPress.
I do not own this tool and don't have its source code. I'd originally found this tool at http://merill.net/2008/03/dasblog-to-blogml-converter/
but was lost when MSDn re-organized tehir archive gallery. This is the binaries I'd on my local machine that I used to export
my own dasBlog driven blog at http://www.ShitalShah.com.
